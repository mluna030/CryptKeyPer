# Rust-based Cryptographic Key Management API

This project aims to develop a Rust-based API for cryptographic key management, focusing on deterministic random bit generation (HMAC_DRBG), mnemonic seed handling, and XMSS (eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme) implementation. The goal is to create a modular, reusable, and secure library that can be integrated into various projects requiring cryptographic functionalities.
